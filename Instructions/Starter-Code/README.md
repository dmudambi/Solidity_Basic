### Contract Creation and Process
In this HW assignemnt, we were given the task to create a smart contract using Remix. With the help of the precoded 'AssociateProfitSplitter.sol' file, we were able to add a few variables and modify existing funtions to help define the functionality of the smart contract. Three payable public variables were created: employee_one, employee_two, and employee_three. These are the payable varibles for our smart contracts. Next, using the given construcor function we were able to set the three variables to payable adresses. Using the balance and deposit functions, a payable wei amount could be deposited. With the remainder amount of wei that would not be accepted, the remainder amount was multiplied by three and sent back to Human Resources using the msg.sender operand. 

The 'Screenshots' folder encapsulates the process in sending a sample ETH amoun too three other accounts. The pictures given in the folder provide the necessary steps to successfully sending the transaction across with the help of Ganache, Metamask, and Remix.
